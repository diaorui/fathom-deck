      "description": "I have a bachelor's in Electrical Engineering and a master's in Computer Science. For the past three years, I\u2019ve been working as a Computer Vision Engineer. I\u2019ve always wanted to transition into robotics, but opportunities are almost non-existent where I live (a developing country with very limited robotics industry). I\u2019m now planning to move abroad to a country with better robotics opportunities and work as a Robotics Engineer. I\u2019ve started learning advanced computer vision for robotics and embedded systems, but I\u2019m unsure about the best path forward. I\u2019d really appreciate advice on: 1. How to search for robotics opportunities (especially from abroad)? 2. How to prepare for robotics/robotics-software interviews? 3. What skills to build to become a competitive candidate? 4. Any general tips from people who made the same transition Thanks in advance for any help!"
