      "description": "Once upon a time I used this app Voyager and that was a lovely little app. I put 1,200 into their VGX coin and turned it into 89k at one point. Thinking this was the future I held, against the advice of many who told me to buy two Bitcoin and pull it off the platform. I didn\u2019t. But in the end I got 7k back. Yay!! Now I\u2019m dipping my toe back in to see if it\u2019s warm and I\u2019m having fun. I got the Coinbase credit card and this is after about a week of spending (I\u2019m moving across the country so lots of expenses) anyone else using the card? Would love to get the $250 BTC bonus if yall are thinking about it. Let me refer you! I only need 5 hahaha which is an insane amount to find. 5 people to sign up for a random credit card. Ok Temu"

      "description": "Unfortunately, this is the last meme in the series. I have to admit defeat to Bitcoin. After 153 memes/days, Bitcoin has not risen to $200,000. In fact, it has fallen. But that's okay. I hope I was able to entertain you for a long time with good Bitcoin memes and at the same time prove that it is not possible to predict/time BTC. I've collected a whole bunch of Bitcoin memes and wanted to share them with you! <3 Bitcoin doesn't need us. But we need Bitcoin! See you at 200k^^ \ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udde1"
