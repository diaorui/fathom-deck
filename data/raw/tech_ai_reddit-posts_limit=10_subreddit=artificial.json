It started out alright and seemed to be tracking things well, until it gave me some confusing information about the layout of a room and after that everything devolved into random chaos. As it stands, I\u2019d say it could work well if you have no short term memory. Otherwise, the technology is just not there yet. And that\u2019s sad because finding time and people to play DND with is a challenge all on its own."

      "description": "AI is quietly changing the way we read. It\u2019s not just helping us produce content\u2014it\u2019s sharpening our ability to sense the difference between writing that has real depth and writing that only performs depth on the surface. Many people are experiencing something like an upgrade in \u201ccontent density resolution,\u201d the ability to feel how many layers of reasoning, structure, and judgment are actually embedded in a piece of text. Before AI, we often mistook length for complexity or jargon for expertise because there was no clear baseline to compare against. Now, after encountering enough AI-generated text\u2014with its smooth surfaces, single-layer logic, and predictable patterns\u2014the contrast makes genuine density more visible than ever. As this contrast sharpens, reading in the AI era begins to feel like switching from 720p to 4K. Flat content is instantly recognizable. Shallow arguments reveal themselves within a few sentences. Emotional bait looks transparent instead of persuasive. At the same time, the rare instances of multi-layer reasoning, compressed insight, or non-linear structure stand out like a different species of writing. AI unintentionally trains our perception simply by presenting a vast quantity of material that shares the same low-density signature. The moment you notice that some writing \u201cmoves differently,\u201d that it carries internal tension or layered judgment, your density resolution has already shifted. This leads to a future where the real competition in content isn\u2019t about volume, speed, or aesthetics\u2014it\u2019s about layers. AI can generate endless text, but it cannot easily reproduce the structural depth of human reasoning. Even casual users now report that AI has made it easier to \u201csee through\u201d many posts, articles, or videos they used to find convincing. And if you can already explain\u2014or at least feel\u2014why certain writing hits harder, lasts longer in your mind, or seems structurally alive, it means your perception is evolving. AI may automate creation, but it is upgrading human discernment, and this perceptual shift may become one of the most significant side effects of the AI era."

      "description": "Hey all, amidst all the downsides of AI this past year - be it environmental worries, slop in music and art, AI enshittification, GPU/RAM prices increasing - I wanted to discuss about what's how WE are using AI, among a general look at changes on a larger scale. Personally, it feels like I haven't really felt a huge difference within the stuff I use which is just the basic stuff like GPT / Gemini. However, one change for me was that I've been using it for language learning which I've felt has been quite useful. On a general level, I feel like I've been seeing some practical applications that improved considerably this year compared to last years. An example I've seen recently is in health, where AI imaging can catch breast cancer way earlier and with higher accuracy. Another is in programming, where it feels like there's a huge rise in \"Vibes Coding\" with even sites like Bolt/v0. Now I'm not gonna pretend like I know how any of these work, but I do think it's interesting how there's a practical use for AI in these fields now. What about for you guys? Has AI gotten better or worse this year, and where did you actually feel the difference?"
