    "title": "Your AI Strategy Needs to Expand Beyond the U.S. and China",
    "description": "While the U.S. and China may be at the center of the AI boom, they don\u2019t have a monopoly on AI innovation. As businesses seek to strengthen their AI capabilities, leaders shouldn\u2019t overlook the many other countries that excel in different aspects of AI. In practice, this means actively scouting and leveraging countries\u2019 AI strengths, based on your company\u2019s needs. Leaders should evaluate opportunities in countries like Canada, Japan, and elsewhere by looking at the presence of venture capital, defense orientation, energy availability, university AI research, government involvement, the software ecosystem, and the availability of consumer data. When crafting their global AI strategy, leaders should: look for locations that meet a specific need, pay attention to cultural norms, plan a localized execution strategy, and think about the legal and cultural landscape.",
