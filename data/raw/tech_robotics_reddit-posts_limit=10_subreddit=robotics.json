      "description": "How is this even possible without a motor or hydraulics as the post claims? I can clearly see the hydraulic hoses on the upper part of the exo skeleton. While the lower part is just plain addition without any active peripherals. Is this just plain manually powered hydraulics + some servo motors? or some new tech?!"

      "description": "Videoshows a driverless Waymo entering a police felony stop perimeter in Downtown LA. The Incident: The vehicle navigated just a few feet from officers during a tense standoff while a suspect was on the ground. The Failure: The planner technically worked (it didn't hit anyone) but it completely failed to read the room. It highlights that current AVs have zero concept of danger or social context beyond basic geometry. Outcome: Passengers were safe, but officers had to shout commands at a car that couldn't understand the urgency.

      "description": "Hi all, Looking for suggestions for an application where I need to send commands to the arm via some field bus (preferably EtherCAT). Ideally I want to send start positions, end positions, velocity abd move style (moveJ, MoveL) and have the robot do the rest. This would be mixed with pre established routines on the robot which would also be called via field bus. Any experience with similar applications? Any recommendations on brands to go with or to stay away from? We would not need a cobot for this application, just a standard 6 axis arm. Thanks!"
