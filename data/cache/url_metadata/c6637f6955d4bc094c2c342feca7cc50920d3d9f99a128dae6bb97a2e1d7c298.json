    "description": "Here\u2019s how Michael Saylor\u2019s Bitcoin treasury company Strategy Inc. is supposed to work: The firm raises funds to buy Bitcoin; that buying drives up the price of Bitcoin; the share price of Strategy follows suit. Rinse and repeat. The trade, helped along by the utter self-belief of Saylor as a hype capitalist on par with OpenAI Inc.\u2019s Sam Altman, has been so lucrative it has spawned dozens of imitators hoping to capture the same \u201cinfinite money glitch,\u201d like a cheat code on a video game.",
