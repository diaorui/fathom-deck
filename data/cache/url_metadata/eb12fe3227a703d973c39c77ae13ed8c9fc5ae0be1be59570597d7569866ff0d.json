    "title": "Intel Finally Posts Open-Source Gaudi 3 Driver Code For The Linux Kernel",
    "description": "The good news is that Intel tonight posted a pull request for open-source Gaudi 3 accelerator support for the mainline Linux kernel! The bad news is that it's coming quite late in the product cycle, much later than the former excellent Habana Labs open-source track record, and their hopes of squeezing this code into the Linux 6.19 kernel may be dashed.",
