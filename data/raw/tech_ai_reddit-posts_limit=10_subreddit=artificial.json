What surprised me is how quickly they started having long, emotionally heavy conversations with it instead of just testing features. Is this kind of high-emotion engagement common with conversational agents? Curious if others building dialog systems have seen the same pattern."

      "description": "It feels like everytime you go on any website or make a call to a company for help with a product or want to report a website issue or simply need help recovering an account but you are only ever are answered by AI customer service. A lot of companies have turned to using AI as customer service help but it has many issues that can render it completely useless like being unable to grasp complex issues, questions, simply sending you a link to solve issues, or not understanding what you are communicating. Often times when you have issues with the AI customer service you are almost completely unable to get in contact with an actual person who can help and or are told to do the same things over and over again by the bot. I wish companies would simply realize that humans are way more efficient and qualified to provide customer service especially because it creates jobs and makes it so that issues can be resolved instead of just sit and marinate over time."
