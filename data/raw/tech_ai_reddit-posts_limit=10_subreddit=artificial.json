      "description": "I keep seeing people say that AI is a bubble or that it\u2019s overhyped, but every time I use AI tools I seriously don\u2019t get how people believe that. To me it feels like AI is already capable of doing a huge part of many jobs, including some in healthcare like basic analysis, documentation, nutrition planning, explanations, x-rays, etc. And if it keeps improving even a bit, it seems obvious that a lot of tasks could be automated. So I\u2019m wondering why some people are so convinced it\u2019s a bubble that will \u201cburst.\u201d Is it fear of job loss? Just media exaggeration? Real technical limits I\u2019m not aware of? Or just general skepticism? I want to understand the other side. Do you think AI is actually going to collapse, or do you think it\u2019s going to keep growing and eventually replace certain roles or reduce the number of workers needed? Curious to hear different perspectives, especially from people who think AI is overhyped."
